# üìù Changelog

## Version 2.0.0 - Major Update (October 27, 2025)

### üÜï New Features

#### üîí User Authorization System
- **Added user whitelist** to control who can use bot commands
- Only authorized Discord User IDs can use `/record`, `/stop`, `/status`
- Unauthorized users receive a friendly denial message with their User ID
- Easy to add/remove users via `.env` file configuration
- No authorization = open to all (useful for testing)

**Configuration:**
```env
BOT1_AUTHORIZED_USERS=user_id_1,user_id_2,user_id_3
```

**See:** `AUTHORIZATION.md` for complete guide

#### üéµ Perfect Audio Synchronization
- **All audio tracks now have identical duration**
- Silence is recorded between speech segments
- Individual tracks align perfectly with combined track
- No more manual timeline adjustment in video editors!

**How it works:**
- Continuously writes audio data when speaking
- Writes silence frames when not speaking
- All tracks start and end at the same time
- Late joiners get silence padding from recording start

**Benefits for Editing:**
- Import all tracks into editor
- They sync automatically (same start/end time)
- Edit with confidence - timeline positions are accurate
- Perfect for multi-track editing in Premiere, DaVinci, Final Cut, etc.

**See:** `AUDIO_SYNC.md` for technical details and editing guide
