# ✨ Upgrade to Slash Commands & Buttons

## What Changed?

The bots have been upgraded from **prefix commands** (`!`) to modern **Discord slash commands** (`/`) with interactive **buttons**!

## Before vs After

### Before (Old Prefix Commands)
```
!record #voice-1 TRAYB
!stop
!status
```

### After (New Slash Commands + Buttons)
```
/record channel:#voice-1 teamname:TRAYB
/stop
/status
```

Plus interactive buttons:
- **⏹️ Stop Recording**
- **📊 Check Status**
- **🔄 Refresh Status**

## Benefits of Slash Commands

✅ **Auto-complete** - Discord shows you available options as you type  
✅ **Validation** - Can't make typos or mistakes  
✅ **Professional** - Official Discord integration  
✅ **User-friendly** - Click dropdowns instead of typing channel names  
✅ **Interactive Buttons** - One-click actions  
✅ **No prefix confusion** - Works in any channel  

## Migration Guide

### Configuration Changes

**Old `.env` file:**
```env
BOT1_TOKEN=...
BOT1_PREFIX=!
BOT1_UPLOAD_CHANNEL_ID=...
```

**New `.env` file:**
```env
BOT1_TOKEN=...
BOT1_UPLOAD_CHANNEL_ID=...
```

**No more prefix needed!** Just remove the `PREFIX` lines.

### Command Changes

| Old Command | New Command |
|-------------|-------------|
| `!record #voice TRAYB` | `/record channel:#voice teamname:TRAYB` |
| `!stop` | `/stop` or click **⏹️ Stop Recording** button |
| `!status` | `/status` or click **📊 Check Status** button |

### Discord Bot Permissions

Make sure your bot has these permissions enabled in the Discord Developer Portal:

1. Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Select your bot
3. Go to **Bot** section
4. Under **Privileged Gateway Intents**, enable:
   - ✅ **SERVER MEMBERS INTENT** (optional, but recommended)
   - ✅ **MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT** (no longer needed, but harmless)

5. For slash commands to work, bot invite URL must include `applications.commands` scope:
   ```
   https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&permissions=3165184&scope=bot%20applications.commands
   ```

### First Run

When you first start the bot with the new version:

1. The bot will automatically register slash commands
2. You'll see: `🔄 Registering slash commands...`
3. Then: `✅ Slash commands registered successfully!`
4. Commands may take a few minutes to appear in Discord (up to 1 hour globally)

**To see commands immediately**, restart your Discord client.

## Using the New Bots

### Starting a Recording

Type `/record` and Discord will show you a form:

```
/record
  channel: [Click to select voice channel]
  teamname: [Type team name]
```

After starting, you get this message with buttons:

```
✅ Recording started!
📍 Channel: voice-1
👥 Team: TRAYB

[⏹️ Stop Recording] [📊 Check Status]
```

### Stopping a Recording

**Option 1:** Click the **⏹️ Stop Recording** button  
**Option 2:** Type `/stop`

### Checking Status

**Option 1:** Click the **📊 Check Status** button  
**Option 2:** Type `/status`

You'll see:
```
📊 Recording Status
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Team: TRAYB
Channel: voice-1
Duration: 5m 23s
Participants: 4
Status: 🔴 Recording

[⏹️ Stop Recording] [🔄 Refresh Status]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Slash commands not showing?
- **Wait 5-10 minutes** - Global commands take time to register
- **Restart Discord** - Close and reopen Discord client
- **Re-invite bot** - Use the new invite URL with `applications.commands` scope
- **Check bot is online** - Bot must be running to register commands

### "Application did not respond"?
- Bot might be starting up, wait a moment and try again
- Check bot logs for errors
- Restart the bot

### Buttons not working?
- Make sure you clicked the button (not just hovering)
- Buttons become invalid after ~15 minutes of inactivity
- Start a new recording to get fresh buttons

### Old commands still work?
- **No**, prefix commands (`!record`, `!stop`, `!status`) are completely removed
- You must use slash commands (`/record`, `/stop`, `/status`)

## Rollback (if needed)

If you need to go back to prefix commands, you can:

1. Check out the previous commit
2. Or manually re-add prefix command code

However, we **strongly recommend** using slash commands as they're the modern Discord standard!
